# FOREGOUND_COLOR and BACKGROUND_COLOR can have one of the following values:
# black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, default (can be
# transparent), green (not standard, but works)
#
# Optional ATTRIBUTE parameters can be (from ncurses manual):
# normal      - default (no highlight)
# standout    - best highlighting mode of the terminal
# underline   - underlining
# reverse     - reverse video
# blink       - blinking
# dim         - half bright
# bold        - extra bright or bold
# protect     - protected mode
#
# You can specify a list of attributes separated by commas: attr1,attr2,attr3.
# Don't use spaces anywhere in such a list.
#
# With colordef you can change the definition of a color. It works only if
# your terminal supports it, if not those lines will be silently ignored.
# COLOR must be a valid color name and the RED GREEN and BLUE are numbers
# from 0 to 1000. Example:
#
# colordef red = 1000 0 0
#
# HINT: you have only 8 colors, but combined with attributes bold and/or
# reversed you actually get more colors.
#
# If you don't specify some elements, the default values will be used.
